Bam
===

A super simple deployment utility, it's basically an opinionated abstraction of rsync served in a capistrano fashion. Capistrano is a super cool utility, I love it, I use it all the time. But for smaller projects (websites, sinatra apps, etc), I think it's simply overkill. With a combination of rsync and git (well actually not really, bam simply allows git to do what git does best... version management). 

Installation
============

    gem install bam
